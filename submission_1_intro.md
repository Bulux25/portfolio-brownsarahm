# Portfolio Check 1

I've demonstrated level 2 for process in [Podcast Review](check1/Podcast_) by explaining the phases and how they related to the topic that episode. I also explained how it helped me improve in analyzing and problem solving in my assingments.

I had trouble with assignment 4, so I redid that to demonstrate level 2 python in [Python](check1/analysis_) I explained the process of my code, I went in details in what each line of code was doing. Also across my 4 chapters, I managed to learn how to seperate data into two different tables. Although some were not taught in class i took the time to serach how i can use different codes in different ways

I've demonstrated level 3 for summarize in [Analysing and learning new things](check1/analysis_) I in details specified each step that I did. In the beginning I wrote a summary of what the table looked like. Each steps was very detailed and at the end i wrote another summary of how the table looked in the end.  

I demonstrate level 3 python throughout all of the chapters because I demonstarted that I understand and I am capable of explaining my code. I am able to complete assignments differntly and I am confortable in using pandas and seaborn.
